# Healthcare MCP App

A NestJS-based healthcare application with patient authentication, therapist management, appointment scheduling, and **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for chat-based interactions**.

## Features

- **Patient Authentication**: Register and login with JWT tokens
- **Therapist Management**: View available therapists and their specializations
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Create, view, and manage appointments
- **MongoDB Integration**: Persistent data storage
- **JWT Security**: Secure authentication without Passport complexity
- **üÜï MCP Server**: Chat interface for patient interactions via AI assistants

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MongoDB (via Docker)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start MongoDB:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Seed therapist data:
   ```bash
   pnpm run seed:therapists
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üÜï MCP Server Features

The healthcare app now implements the **proper Model Context Protocol (MCP)** architecture with a separate MCP server process.

### Architecture Flow:
```
User ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí NestJS Backend ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí MCP Server ‚Üí Result ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí NestJS ‚Üí Frontend
```

### **What We've Built:**

1. **üèóÔ∏è Separate MCP Server** (`mcp-server.js`) - Runs as a separate process
2. **üîå MCP Client Service** - NestJS service that connects to the MCP server
3. **üß† LLM Service** - OpenAI integration for planning and formatting
4. **üí¨ Chat Controller** - Main endpoint that orchestrates the entire pipeline

### **Available MCP Tools:**

#### **`list_therapists`**
- Lists all available therapists with specializations
- No parameters required
- Example: "Show me all available therapists"

#### **`book_appointment`**
- Books an appointment with a therapist
- Parameters: `therapistId`, `appointmentDate`, `duration`, `notes?`
- Example: "Book me an appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow at 2 PM for 60 minutes"

#### **`list_appointments`**
- Shows all upcoming appointments for a patient
- Parameters: `patientId`
- Example: "Show me my upcoming appointments"

#### **`cancel_appointment`**
- Cancels an existing appointment
- Parameters: `appointmentId`, `cancellationReason?`
- Example: "Cancel my appointment with ID abc123"

#### **`get_profile`**
- Retrieves patient profile information
- Parameters: `patientId`
- Example: "Show me my profile"

### **How It Works:**

1. **User sends message** to `/chat` endpoint
2. **OpenAI analyzes** the message and determines which MCP tool to call
3. **MCP Client** connects to the external MCP server process
4. **MCP Server** executes the tool and returns results
5. **OpenAI formats** the result into friendly text
6. **Response returned** to the user

### **Setup Instructions:**

1. **Start MCP Server** (in separate terminal):
   ```bash
   pnpm run mcp:server
   ```

2. **Start NestJS App** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   pnpm run start:dev
   ```

3. **Test the Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"Show me available therapists"}'
   ```

### **Benefits of This Architecture:**

- ‚úÖ **True MCP Protocol** - Follows the actual MCP specification
- ‚úÖ **Separate Processes** - MCP server can run independently
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** - Multiple NestJS instances can connect to one MCP server
- ‚úÖ **Standard Compliant** - Works with any MCP-compatible client
- ‚úÖ **Clean Separation** - Each component has a single responsibility

JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

## üß† **Intelligent Chat with OpenAI**

The healthcare app now uses **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo** to intelligently understand user requests:

### **How It Works:**

1. **User sends message** (e.g., "Book me an appointment with Dr. Smith tomorrow at 2 PM for 60 minutes")
2. **OpenAI analyzes** the message and extracts:
   - **Intent**: `book-appointment`
   - **Parameters**: `therapistId`, `appointmentDate`, `duration`, `notes`
   - **Authentication requirement**: `true`
3. **MCP Server executes** the appropriate tool with extracted parameters
4. **Result returned** to user through the chat interface

### **Example Conversations:**

```
User: "I need to see a therapist for anxiety"
Assistant: "I can help you find a therapist. Let me show you the available options..."
[Lists therapists]

User: "Book me an appointment with Dr. Johnson next Tuesday at 3 PM for 90 minutes"
Assistant: "I'll book that appointment for you. I need you to be logged in first..."
[Books appointment after authentication]

User: "Show me my upcoming appointments"
Assistant: "Here are your upcoming appointments..."
[Lists appointments]
```

### **Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Natural language understanding** - No need for specific commands
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent parameter extraction** - Automatically understands dates, times, durations
- ‚úÖ **Context awareness** - Understands user intent from various phrasings
- ‚úÖ **Professional responses** - Human-like conversation flow
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - Gracefully handles unclear requests
